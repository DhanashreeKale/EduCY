I am one of the Backend Member of EduCy.
### About:
Due to the current Covid-19 situation, online learning is the only way to keep the education system going. Before the crisis there were some processes 
which were being done online by many institutes but the traditional pen and paper work would still remain. This crisis has caused a sudden shift from 
offline mode of education to complete online mode of education. Recruitment of candidates in online form can also be a challenge, we aim to solve that 
problem too so that recruiters can use the EduCy application to search and see the studentâ€™s profile that is legitimate. The motive behind engineering 
EduCy, an application is to be able to efficiently manage and tackle a few of these problems.
